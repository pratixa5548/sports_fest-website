            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective: The objective of table tennis is to score points by hitting the ball over the net onto the opponent's side of the table in such a way that the opponent is unable to return it.</li><br>
                <li>Serve: The game begins with a serve, where one player tosses the ball into the air and strikes it with the paddle so that it bounces on their side of the table once before crossing the net and bouncing on the opponent's side. The serve must be made from behind the end line of the table and must land in the diagonal half of the opponent's side of the table.</li><br>
                <li>Rally: After the serve, players take turns hitting the ball back and forth over the net. The ball must bounce on the opponent's side of the table before being returned.</li><br>
                <li>Scoring: A point is scored when the opponent is unable to return the ball in accordance with the rules. Points are awarded for each successful rally, and the first player to reach 11 points wins the game. However, if the score reaches 10-10, the game continues until one player has a two-point lead.
