            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective: The objective of basketball is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</li><br>
                <li>Teams: Basketball is typically played between two teams, each consisting of five players on the court at a time.</li><br>
                <li>Scoring: Points are scored by shooting the ball into the opponent's hoop. A field goal, made from anywhere on the court during normal play, is worth two points, while a shot made from beyond the three-point line is worth three points. Free throws, awarded after certain fouls, are worth one point each.</li><br>
                <li>Gameplay: The game begins with a jump ball at center court, where a referee tosses the ball into the air, and one player from each team jumps to try to tap the ball to a teammate. The team that wins the jump ball gains possession of the ball to start the game.</li><br>
                <li>Dribbling: Players must dribble the ball (bounce it on the floor) while moving around the court. If a player stops dribbling or double dribbles (dribbles with both hands), it is considered a violation, and the opposing team gains possession of the ball.
